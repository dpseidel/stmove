# stmove

The goal of stmove is to make more accessible and transparent standard spatio-temporal
approaches to interpreting movement data before getting into more challenging 
aspects of deconstructing movement trajectories.  Analyses in this package expect
“clean, regular, movement data time series” which consists of a sequence of
points `(x, y, time)` where `time = 0, 1, 2, 3,..., T` and all missing points 
have been interpolated and filled in.

The primary function of this package is `build_report` which, given a clean
regularized trajectory, will deliver a .Rmd and .pdf report including the 
results of the following computations. 

### Basic path distributions:
1. Generate step size time series S={(t,s(t)) | over [0,T]} and plot step-size histogram
2. Generate turning angle time series A={(t,a(t)) | over [0,T]} and plot turning angle distribution

### Basic path statistics:
1. If data is sub hourly, plot running means, standard deviations, and auto 
correlations for s(t) and a(t), plus cross-correlation s(t)-a(t) (basic stats 
collection: BSC) using a 3 hour (or 6 hour if data is only hourly) "sliding time window” (STW)
2. Generate and plot 12-hourly BSC  using a 12 hour “jumping time window” (JTW)
3. Generate and plot 14/15 day BSC following a new-full-new moon sequence using a JTW
4. Generate and plot seasonal BSC for how ever many seasons are available using a JTW

### Basic path visualizations.
1.  Plot the trajectory over space
2.  Generate a wavelet plot that allows us to visualize possible periodic 
components in s(t) and a(t), auto and cross correlation coefficients.

### Basic space constructions:
1.  Construct 25%, 50%  and 95% home range isopleths (optionally by season) using two methods: 
    1. `k-LoCoH` hull sets
    2. autocorrelated utilization distribution analysis implemented with `ctmm::akde`

Once these are done, one can then pursue various kinds of analysis that address 
questions of interest (e.g., GLM models of location and landscape, HMM modeling,
step section analysis), but this package strives to set a standard for what is 
minimally needed before embarking on such analyses.

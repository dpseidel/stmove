Title: Build reproducible reports for spatial-temporal animal movement analysis
Description: A system for building reports containing a minimal set of spatial,
    temporal computations on regular trajectories of animal relocation data. 
    You provide the data, and stmove will build a report highlighting basic
    distributions, statistics, visualizations, and home range constructions for your 
    trajectory.

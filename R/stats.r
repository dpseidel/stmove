# 1.  If data is sub hourly, plot running means, standard deviations, and
# auto correlations for s(t) and a(t), plus cross-correlation
# s(t)-a(t) (basic stats collection: BSC) using a 3 hour (or 6 hour if
# data is only hourly) “sliding time window” (STW)
# 2.  Generate and plot 12-hourly BSC using a 12 hour “jumping time
# window” (JTW)
# 3.  Generate and plot 14/15 day BSC following a new-full-new moon
# sequence using a JTW
# 4.  Generate and plot seasonal BSC for how ever many seasons are

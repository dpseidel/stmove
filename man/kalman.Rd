\title{Kalman Smoothing with Structural Time Series}
\usage{
kalman(df, warn = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing columns x, y, date representing relocations in space and time.}

\item{warn}{logical, should warnings be issued if interpolation is above 5% ?}
}
\value{
a dataframe with additional binary column \code{real} flagging those points whose positions were interpolated.
